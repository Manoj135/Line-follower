Build a fully autonomous bot based on line follower mechanism which can detect colours and sound frequencies. The arena consists of
various color coded checkpoints and 2 sound sources placed perpendicular to each other to avoid interference.

The bot has to identify the color of the checkpoint. If the color is GREEN then the bot has to move in the direction from where the 
sound is coming and if the color is RED the bot has to move in the direction opposite to the direction of approaching sound wave.
